$$
x\_{FIS} =  (\\prod\_{g=1}^{6} SS\_{i,g}^{C\_{i,g}})^\\frac{1}{\\sum{C\_{i,g}}}
$$

Variables:

-   *S**S*: stock status score, based on B/Bmsy and an underharvest
    penalty adjustment
-   *C*: total catch
-   *i*: OHI reporting region
-   *g*: level of taxonomic grouping (ISSCAAP)</small>

## Results

    output:
      md_document:
        variant: "markdown_github"

having other options (HTML, PDF, Word), move this output type below the
first option.
